You arrived at the tower. 
You feel ominous.
You open the large doors and a greeted by a horrendous sight.
There is a strong pungent smell emanating from a white substance on the floor.
It seems to be a decade old, yet it has engraved its marks on the building.
You immediately sense that it is not ordinary.
While looking for the owner of the tower, you come across goblins.
