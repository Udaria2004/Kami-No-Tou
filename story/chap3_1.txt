You say goodbye to your loved ones as you head out for your quest.

You wonder who is this mad man thinking of taking over the world, while you walk towards the destination.
Most adventurers would have taken a horse. But you did not... more like you couldn't afford one.

But you were hopeful that you would get a huge sum from this quest and would get promoted to a higher rank.

After a long tiring journey which seemed like forever, you got to the outskirts of the premises.
Slowly, but surely, you made your finally made it to the Tower.
It was massive beyond anything you had seen.

The entrance was barricaded by 2 large doors.

You weren't sure if you should step inside or not

Upon entering, you observed that a rather pungent odour was coming from deep inside the tower.
You also noticed that there were stairs leading up. Obviously the villain would be at the top.
You start climbing stairs.
