After defeating the minions, a masked man shows himself, presumably the master of the tower and the wanted man from the quest.
You engage in a decisive fight to save the world.
You thwart his evil plans.
You finally unmask him, and you find out he is your dad.
He says he was under the influence of the milk.
You all return home happily ever after.
